# Helsinki-places
### Author: Jun Zhang \<jun.1.zhang@aalto.fi>

This project is the solution of a coding task from Accenture. A web program that lists and displacy places in Helsinki is implemented with React as frontend and Node.js as backend. To develop this program, I use the [Jason Watmore's work](https://github.com/cornflourblue/react-node-server-side-pagination) as a basic skeleton.

## Get started

Clone this repo :

Install dependencies for backend :

`cd server`

`yarn install`

Start the backend in production mode :

`yarn start`

Then for the frontend :

`cd front`

`yarn install`

`yarn start`
